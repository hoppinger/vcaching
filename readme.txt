Wordpress Varnish Cache integration

== Description ==
Complete Wordpress Varnish Cache integration.

This plugin handles all integration with Varnish Cache. It was designed for high traffic websites.

Main features

* admin interface, see screenshots
* console for manual purges, supports regular expressions so you can purge an entire folder or just a single file
* supports every type of Varnish Cache implementation, see screenshots for examples
* unlimited number of Varnish Cache servers
* use of custom headers when communicating with Varnish Cache does not interfere with other caching plugins, cloudflare, etc
* purge key method so you don't need to setup ACLs
* debugging
* actively maintained

You can control the following from the Varnish Caching admin panel :

* Enable/Disable caching
* Homepage cache TTL
* Cache TTL (for every other page)
* IPs/Hosts to clear cache to support every type of Varnish Cache implementation
* Override default TTL in posts/pages
* Purge key based PURGE
* Debugging option
* console for precise manual purges

This plugin also auto purges Varnish Cache when your site is modified.

Varnish Caching sends a PURGE request to Varnish Cache when a page or post is modified. This occurs when editing, publishing, commenting or deleting an item, and when changing themes.
Not all pages are purged every time, depending on your Varnish configuration. When a post, page, or custom post type is edited, or a new comment is added, <em>only</em> the following pages will purge:

* The front page
* The post/page edited
* Any categories or tags associated with the page

<a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/">Varnish Cache</a> is a web application accelerator also known as a caching HTTP reverse proxy. You install it in front of any server that speaks HTTP and configure it to cache the contents. This plugin <em>does not</em> install Varnish for you, nor does it configure Varnish for WordPress. It's expected you already did that on your own using the provided config files.

Inspired from the following :

* https://wordpress.org/plugins/varnish-http-purge/
* https://github.com/dreamhost/varnish-vcl-collection/

Implemented on :

* www.bvoltaire.fr

== Installation ==

Use the provided config files for Varnish Cache located in /wp-content/plugins/vcaching/varnish-conf folder. Just edit the backend IP/port and ACLs.
You can also use the purge key method. You must fill in lib/purge.vcl the purge key.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What version of Varnish is supported? =

This was built and tested on Varnish 3.x. Varnish 4.x is WIP.

= Why doesn't every page flush when I make a new post? =

The only pages that should purge are the post's page, the front page, categories, and tags.

Click the 'Purge ALL Varnish Cache' button on the "Right Now" Dashboard.

= How do I manually purge cache? =

Use the console. For example you can purge the whole uploads folder with the URL /wp-content/uploads/.*

Statistics need a special setup. More info on the Statistics tab on your Wordpress environment.

= How do I configure my Varnish Cache VCL? =

Use the provided Varnish Cache configuration files located in /wp-content/plugins/vcaching/varnish-conf folder.
